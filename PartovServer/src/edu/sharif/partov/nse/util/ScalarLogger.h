 * Description:       This class allows to log scalar values from any object of a map. The
 *                    results can be fetched by all objects living in map's thread while the
 *                    map thread is running. It also will be saved in a file in the map's folder
 *                    when the map get deleted.
 *                    NOTE: Only objects living in the related map's thread are allowed to
 *                    set and/or get values. Otherwise race condition will arise.

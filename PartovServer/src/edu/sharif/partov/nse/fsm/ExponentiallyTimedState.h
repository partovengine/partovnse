/**
 * Name:              ExponentiallyTimedState
 * Parent:            QState
 * Description:       A state which will exit after an exponentially distributed time.
 *                    N outgoing activatable transitions must be given to this state.
 *                    Each transition must be associated with one rate, and after an
 *                    exponentially distributed time (having that rate) the transition
 *                    (with minimum time to be fired) will be enabled/activated and
 *                    then fired.
 *                    BTW, this state can inteoperate with all other states and
 *                    transitions and it does not expect that only exponentially timed
 *                    transitions exist (you can add any other transition to it).
 *                    NOTE: Using removeTransition method will cause undefined behavior.

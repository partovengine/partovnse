=== 1. INTRODUCTION

====================================================================================
 Partov is a simulation engine, supporting emulation as well,
 making it possible to create virtual networks.

====================================================================================
===
=== 2. HOW TO INSTALL CENTRAL PARTOV SERVER
===
====================================================================================
For installing central Partov server you need to install following dependencies:
 1. MySQL/MariaDB Database Management System (for users' information)
 2. libpcap 1.5.1 or above (both its library and dev version for emulation capabilities)
 3. Qt 5 development libraries (latest tested version is 5.5.1)

After installing MySQL database, use the ``PartovServer/deploy/bin/createdb.sql'' SQL
file in order to create a database, user account, and required table/contents (you need
to edit and adjust its contents like password).
Database keeps users' accounts and is required for logging in the central Partov server
via Client Framework (CF) instances.

For compiling the central Partov server open a terminal at PartovServer folder and
issue qmake for creating the Makefile (based on your machine settings) and then
issue make for compiling source codes as follows:

$  qmake
$  make

This will create ``partov'' binary file in the ``PartovServer/deploy/bin/'' folder.
Partov is tested with libpcap 1.6.2 and uses new libpcap (after 1.0) API to capture
packets.
If you faced errors during compilation, complaining about missing pcap_* functions,
it means that you do not have latest version of libpcap installed. You can enable
backward compatibility (with pre 1.0 libpcap API) by uncommenting the related define
statement ``#define USE_PRE_ONE_PCAP_API'' at the beginning of
``PartovServer/src/edu/sharif/partov/nse/emulation/EthernetDirectAccessDriver.cpp''
and then running the ``make'' again.

Partov captures packets using libpcap and so it requires to be either executed-as-root
or to have network capturing capability. Considering the least priveledge principle
you can give required capabilities to that binary by running "setcapabilities.sh"
script.

Next step is to edit ``PartovServer/deploy/config/config.ini'' and indicate which
network interfaces you want to be used, which port should be used for CF connections
and other settings like server execution timeout, database credentials, and so on.
It's also required to update the ``PartovServer/deploy/config/routers.map'' file and
indicate the interface name (e.g. eth0, enp1s0, etc.). That map file contains
a virtual map of routers which are connected to physical network interfaces.
This map will be instantiated during the central Partov server startup and will be
used as the gateway of other virtual maps.

Afterwards, you can run the Partov's binary.
If all dependencies were already installed, central Partov server will start working
and listening for CF connection on 7890 TCP port (by default).
It's also possible to use ``service_up.sh'' file in ``PartovServer/deploy/bin/'' folder
for running central Partov server and re-launching it whenever it was killed by
any means (as a non killable service). For killing it again, you can use
the ``kill_service.sh'' file from same folder.

For designing virtual networks maps, see the sample map files which are placed under
the ``PartovServer/deploy/maps/'' folder. There you will find ``map.xsd'' file which
using modern XML editors (e.g. Rinzo plugin for Eclipse) provides auto-completion for
writing PTL map files.

It's also possible to compile central Partov server for win32 systems using
the win32 dependencies of Qt5 (placing them in win32-dep folder, on parent folder of
the PartovServer folder) and the winpcap instead of the libpcap.

====================================================================================
===
=== 3. Client Framework (CF)
===
====================================================================================
You can find the Client Framework in the CF folder. You can pass this folder to
distributed users.
The CF contains two folders: The ``base'' folder which is responsible for connecting
to the central Partov server and the "user" folder which contains the simulation
code (this code can be run as it's placed on a virtual node within the virtual network
in the central Partov server).

The CF folder contains a small README file too.
Anyway, the CF does not have any special dependency and should be compilable on
most Linux systems by default.

# Partov NSE

The _Partov Network Simulation Emulation (PartovNSE)_ is an engine for discrete event simulation, extensible through plugins, joining real networks via emulation, supporting realtime scheduling, and a lot more.
Latest stable version of Partov central server is **3.4.0**.

## Installation

See the _INSTALL_ file for the manual installation guide.

## Usage

After completing installation and updating config file,
move to _PartovServer/deploy/bin/_ folder and either run

    ./launcher.bash

to start the Partov server (stop it using Ctrl+C signal) or run

    ./service_up.sh

to initiate a watcher process which starts Partov server and
restarts it after any interrupt (Ctrl+C will cause restart
instead of termination). You can use

    ./kill_service.sh
